If you believe that information in your personal credit report is inaccurate or incomplete, please visit our website at experian.com/validate dispute or call us at XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX to speak directly to an Experian consumer assistance representative. \\\" However, an Experian confirmation number was not even provided on this notice.

I have repeated the process of dispute when these charge off were reported after bankruptcy for each creditor that is reporting a charge off. Some are not only reporting a charge off after bankruptcy, they changed payment history to reflect a charge off prior to bankruptcy which is untrue. Prior credit reports show that the accounts were not charge off prior to bankruptcy. The credits retroactively changed payment history to charge off after bankruptcy.

It appears to us that the firm has done nothing which has injured you. Understanding our position requires some understanding of a complicated and, in some ways confusing set of laws relating to the bankruptcy and the real estate which you own. Your state has an exemption for a certain amount of equity in real estate. That is to say in a bankruptcy the creditors can not sell your residence to satisfy their judgment if you have less equity in the home than the amount of the exemption. The bankruptcy court can only order a creditor whose judgment has matured into a lien on your property to release that lien if you have equity in the real estate and that equity is less than the amount of the exemption provided under your state \\'s laws.  The problem here is that at the time of your bankruptcy you had no equity in the house. That is to say the amount of the mortgage was equal to or greater than the fair market value of the home. Under those circumstances the court can not enter an order to avoid the lien of the judgment. There was nothing that could have been done to get the court to do that. We attach hereto a copy of the Court \\'s opinion on our motion to avoid the lien which states what I have just told you.  While there was n\\'t a motion filed during your bankruptcy to avoid the lien, the Court has made it clear that it would have denied such a motion in any event. This does n\\'t mean that you still owe the money to that creditor. You do n\\'t! The judgment and the debt are discharged. The creditor can not take any action against you to collect the debt or enforce the lien. You should be able to refinance your mortgage without worry merely by showing the lender that you received a discharge in bankruptcy.  I hope this is helpful and that you will be able to fulfill your economic plans in the future.  \"\n",

Sending me a letter stating that no reinvestigation will be taken unless I provide further information from data furnishers, courts, etc. and that I must resolve the issue with the creditors myself is a clear violation under the FCRA.

Can you help clarify this problem, never bounced check, had no problems except someone deposited a check while my husband and were overseas but the bank accepted it even though they put wrong address on deposit slip and it was deposited out of state. That happened over 3 months ago and we thought the matter was settled.   XXXX XXXX  \"\n",

The XXXX week i was asked to purchased some equipment ( valued at {$7400.00} XXXX and send out of country to a new office being opened. Being careful throughout this whole process about identity theft, I provided no personal info, in fact the hiring company said a few times that no personal info was required untill I passed the 4 weeks of training and met the hiring manager for the final interview. So for the XXXX project I was issued XXXX that had an account # and routing # XXXX CHASE BANK XXXX with funds that were put into my name that were to be used to purchase the equipment. I was asked to use my personal CC at this time till I became full time employed. I transfered the funds from the account info provided into my personal CC and waited till the funds posted. Once posted a few days later I proceeded to purchase the requested equipment and ship out of country to the designated address. I was requested to use USPS priority international delivery. I was then asked to perform the exact same task a second time which is when I suspected something was n\\'t right and asked a few more questions. At this time the response from XXXX XXXX was not acceptable and knew at this time something was wrong. I sent a final email declining the XXXX project / /purchase and also declined any employement with the company., I then proceeded to stop the shipment that was done earlier that morning with the USPS and was told that I was not able to stop it being it is an international shipment. I then contacted my credit card company \\\" CHASE \\'\\' and explained the situation and was told the funds are OK and no issues. I have been checking my account daily to ensure no issues and on XXXX/XXXX/15, the posted amount of {$8000.00} was reversed from my credit card account. I do not understand how CHASE bank that the funds were transfered from did not know the account I was using to transfer funds does not have a check / balance process in place to review and detect scams like this. A phone call or text or something to the actual owner of the account. Besides the names being different on the accounts. Todays day and age with technology, banks should be able to detect scams like this.  \"\n",

I tried using it again at the market and again it was declined. so the next day i call my bank and they said my account is closed! they said i commited fraud i did n\\'t understand what i did. They said i should go inside my branch to discuss with the manager so i went in and they told me that the check i deposited bounced and that i withdrew money more then what i had. i explained to them that was a company check and i withdrew because their atm allowed me to take {$200.00} above what i had in my account. So they said they closed all my savings and checking. They put a hold on any money i had in there until they can resolve the issue. The following day i went to the owners bank. XXXX XXXX and explained to manager what happened he said he could n\\'t do much. The owner found out i went to his bank and he really got upset because he said i could of ruined his credit and chances of getting loans. I told him he put me on a black list and it was his fault for bouncing the check he said he was sorry and that he can issue another. That was to late because US bank did n\\'t want to work with me or help me they just shut me down with no phone call or allow me to resolve the issue they just closed all accounts and didnt warn me.

I felt that was wrong because not once did they call me to resolve this or give me the chance to fix it. I only found out when i tried to put gas. This has been now years of stress that i can not open any checking account. I have XXXX account and only because my father opened it for me. Its very difficult with only having XXXX bank when they are closed weekends and they are XXXX from me if i ever want to walk inside the branch. I would like US Bank to please take me off this list as it was inaccurate and not fraud.  \"\n",

Note, my mtge payment had been deducted from wife \\'s checking account monthly until I, not my wife, declared bankruptcy last XXXX, 2015. - then they stopped making direct withdrawals from her account. I had been instructed to contact their point of contact office and did so several times. They sent me a packet of forms to fill out, including my financials, reasons why I felt that I should be granted a mtge modification and was told to include any documentation relevant to this case. I did so and received a very perfunctory reply from them which you wrote to me that they sent to me/ you? on XXXX, after their underwriting team took a few weeks to consider my request -- namely that I was turned down due to \\\" item # XXXX \\'\\', which, a few pages into their reply, explained that this was due to the fact that my residence was a co-op!  I then decided to file with your agency and have been receiving annoying calls from the bank almost daily. When I speak to a rep, it \\'s always the same thing -- badgering me when/ if I can pay, asking me if I can borrow from a friend or relative, can I liquidate any XXXX I may have, etc., never any discussion about my proposed installment plan.  note, my initial complaint with them was NEVER resolved. I had asked them to forgive the approx {$930.00} they tacked on to my 2 months mtge payments which are in arrears, for legal fees ( {$820.00} ), + late fees and inspection fees for an additional approx {$100.00}, due to the fact that it was THEY who stopped my payments from being received and the fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX, Santander \\'s attny, never got back to me to resolve this issue nor to address my request for an installment payment way back in XXXX of last year, despite both my and my attorney \\'s trying to resolve this issue with her.  And as for their telling me in their explanation what they have done or will do to solve my problem, they have done neither, just a very tersely worded account stating that since my home us a co-op, that I was not eligible for a loan modification, which is NOT even what I was requesting.p in the first place. All I was requesting was for them to accept my installment plan and to forgive that addtnl {$930.00} they added due to their malfeasance..

THEY HAD JUST LIED IN ORDER TO GET {$380.00} FROM ME. I was very angry at this deception and demanded the {$380.00} back. they refused to give me my money back. wells fargo is truly sleazy bank by the way dont mail anything to the address i give below i dont live there anymore, thanks to wells fargo i went from making {$80000.00} a year to being homeless. its ridiculous how there is no regulation at all of crooked banks like wells fargo  \"\n",

I hear nothing back so i figured the issue was mute. I got another XXXX in XXXX and believed it to be a scam from lvnv funding to get money from me so I ignored it. then i get a court ordered wage garnishment. I responded to the courts and explained that i thought it was a scam and again requested proof and also to vacate the judgement as it would incure an financila hardship. I heard nothing back from the courts. I contacted the nys attorney generals office, the garnishment from XXXX stopped. Then they started again last XXXX. Then they stopped and now theyre starting again. The original amount was XXXX dollars, now its well over XXXX. The account went into default in XXXX that would make it past the statute of limitations. I am not going to pay them this amount of money especially when they bought the debt for less than XXXX. I will file chapter XXXX.  \"\n",
